# Project 1: REDit Web App

## Summary

Throughout the progession of development of this particular project, I was introduced to Web App development accross the full stack.
For the client side I used React to display the user interface and Redux to manage the state of the application.
On the backend I used Express.js to create my web server and PostgreSQL to develop my database.

## Languages and Tools Used

    * React
    * Redux
    * JSX
    * JavaScript(Asynchronous, ES6)
    * Express.js
    * PostgreSQL
    * WebPack
    * Babel



## Learning Outcomes

This project has helped me solidify my understanding of how an application is created using the full stack. It has helped me solidify 
my understanding of how the clientside is connected to the server side, and how the server side communicates to a database to ultimately
deliver the desired data to the client. In addition to this I learned a great deal about authentication (both client and server side), and
encryption (salting & hashing). Last but not least, this project has helped me gain a very strong understanding of React, Redux, and how the
two connect together to make very complex and fun applications.
